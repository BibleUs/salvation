Salvation Space Simulation Game

This game was created for the 2013 Christian Game Dev Speedgame challenge.  The theme was "Salvation", so I made a game about a ship named Salvation that is given to you by your uncle who warns you that the star in your system is going to implode and destroy all but the outer-most planets.  You have a limited time to make it outside the danger zone and pick up as many passengers as you can along the way.

This game was built with:
- Microsoft Dev Studio
- XCode
- Coffee

Using the following libraries:
- Ogre 3D
- MyGUI
- OIS
- SFML (openal, libsndfile)

Content created with:
- Planet Creator
- Spacescape
- Blender3D
- Photoshop
